# Handwritten Digit Recognition with TensorFlow

This project demonstrates a simple handwritten digit recognition system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, which contains images of handwritten digits.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV
- Pandas

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install .
```
## Setup
- Clone the repository and navigate into the project directory:
```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_directory>
```
- Prepare the MNIST dataset:
```bash
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()"
```
