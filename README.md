# Machine Learning Projects: Fashion Recommender and Handwritten Digit Recognition

This repository contains two distinct machine learning projects:

1. **Fashion Recommender**: A recommendation system built to predict clothing item preferences using image data. It leverages deep learning techniques to recommend fashion items based on user input.
  
2. **Handwritten Digit Recognition**: A simple handwritten digit classification system built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained on the MNIST dataset to recognize digits from 0-9 in images.

Both projects demonstrate the power of machine learning in practical applications and showcase different techniques such as image classification and recommendation systems.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- OpenCV (for image preprocessing in Handwritten Digit Recognition)
- Other dependencies (listed in `requirements.txt`)
